# Polygon

This C program reads data from a file to initialize an array of polygons. Each polygon consists of a name, the number of points, and an array of coordinates for the points. Since the number of polygons and the number of points in each polygon are unknown, dynamic memory allocation is used to allocate memory for the polygons and their respective points. The program handles varying polygon sizes and ensures that memory is managed efficiently during the reading and storing of data.

## Get Started

1. Run `make` command to compile program. (default compiler - clang, rewrite Makefile with preferred one).

   ```sh
   make hometask
   ```

2. Run program file in console.

   ```sh
   ./hometask
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
