# C Vector

This C program implements a basic dynamic array similar to C++'s std::vector, using a struct to manage the array data and its functions. It supports adding elements and automatically grows the array as needed. The code is modular, split into multiple files with a Makefile for compilation.

## Get Started

1. Run `make` command to compile program. (default compiler - clang, rewrite Makefile with preferred one).

   ```sh
   make
   ```

2. Run program file in console.

   ```sh
   ./hometask
   ```

3. Run `make test_c_vector` to command to compile source file with unit tests (using assert statement).

   ```sh
   make test_c_vector
   ```

4. Run test file in console.

   ```sh
   ./test_c_vector
   ```

5. Run `make test_gtest` to command to compile source file with unit tests (using gtest statement).

   ```sh
   make test_gtest
   ```

6. Run test file in console.

   ```sh
   ./test_gtest
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
