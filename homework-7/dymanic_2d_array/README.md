# Dynamic 2D array

This C program allocates a 2D array of strings and sorts the characters in each row. The user specifies the number of rows, and the program dynamically allocates memory for the array. It includes functionality to sort the rows lexicographically, first comparing the first character of each row, then the second, and so on. The code is modular, split across multiple files with a Makefile for easy compilation.

## Get Started

1. Run `make` command to compile program. (default compiler - clang, rewrite Makefile with preferred one).

   ```sh
   make hometask
   ```

2. Run program file in console.

   ```sh
   ./hometask
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
