# C Vector

This C program implements a basic dynamic array similar to C++'s std::vector, using functions for memory management and resizing. It supports adding elements and automatically grows the array as needed. The code is modular, split into multiple files with a Makefile for compilation.

## Get Started

1. Run `make` command to compile program. (default compiler - clang, rewrite Makefile with preferred one).

   ```sh
   make hometask
   ```

2. Run program file in console.

   ```sh
   ./hometask
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
