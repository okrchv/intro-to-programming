# Max Mantissa

This C program calculate and print key components of the single-precision floating-point (32-bit) format based on the IEEE 754 standard. A single-precision float consists of three parts: a sign bit (to indicate whether the number is positive or negative), an 8-bit exponent (determines the range of the floating-point number), and a 23-bit mantissa (controls the precision of the number). Also program calculates and show the largest representable float value combining both the maximum exponent and mantissa.

## Get Started

1. Compile `max-mantissa.c` file with C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc max-mantissa.c -o max-mantissa
   ```
2. Run program file in console. (The default output executable is called `a.exe` for Windows or `a.out` Unixes and Mac OS)
   ```sh
   ./max-mantissa
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
