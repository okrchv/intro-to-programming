# Rotated matrix

This C program fills a 2D array of size NÃ—N(4x4) with random integers and then performs a rotation operation by transposing the array + reversing each row. Rotation operation performed in place, meaning no extra space is used (i.e., space complexity is O(1)). In addition program use pointers to work with the array elements.

## Get Started

1. Run `make` command to compile program. (default compiler - clang, rewrite Makefile with preferred one)
   ```sh
   make hometask
   ```

2. Run program file in console.
   ```sh
   ./hometask
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.

## Complexity

Time: O(n^2).
Space: O(1).
