# Rotated Array

This C program fills a 2D array of size NÃ—N with random integers and then performs a rotation operation by transposing the array, which converts rows into columns and vice versa. Rotation operation performed in place, meaning no extra space is used (i.e., space complexity is O(1)).

## Get Started

1. Compile `rotated-array.c` file with C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc ../../include/rand_range.c rotated-array.c -o rotated-array
   ```
2. Run program file in console. (The default output executable is called `a.exe` for Windows or `a.out` Unixes and Mac OS)
   ```sh
   ./rotated-array
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
