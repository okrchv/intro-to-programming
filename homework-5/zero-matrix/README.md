# Zero matrix

This C program creates a NxN 2D array, initializing it with random integers in the range [0..10]. The program scans the array for any elements equal to 0, and if found, it sets all elements in the corresponding row and column to 0.

## Get Started

1. Compile `zero-matrix.c` file with C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc ../../include/rand_range.c zero-matrix.c -o zero-matrix
   ```
2. Run program file in console. (The default output executable is called `a.exe` for Windows or `a.out` Unixes and Mac OS)
   ```sh
   ./zero-matrix
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
