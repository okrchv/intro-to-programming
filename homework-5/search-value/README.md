# Search value

This C program generates an array of N(10) random integers, sorts it using bubble sort, and allows the user to search for a specific value with both recursive and iterative binary search. It displays the generated and sorted arrays and reports whether the target value is found.

## Get Started

1. Compile `search-value.c` file with C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc ../../include/rand_range.c search-value.c -o search-value
   ```
2. Run program file in console. (The default output executable is called `a.exe` for Windows or `a.out` Unixes and Mac OS)
   ```sh
   ./search-value
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
2. Supported input types: `int`.
