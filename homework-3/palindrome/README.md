# Palindrome

This C program checks whether the binary representation of an entered integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards, and in this case, it applies to the binary format.

## Get Started

1. Compile `palindrome.c` file with C compiler.
   ```sh
   gcc palindrome.c -o palindrome
   ```
2. Run program file in console. (The default output executable is called `a.exe` for Windows or `a.out` Unixes and Mac OS)
   ```sh
   ./palindrome
   ```

## Usage

1. Follow program instructions during execution.
2. Supported input types: `int`.
